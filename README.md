# tuna_species_classification_tree
Classification tree analysis performed on wildlife sightings to predict species of tuna.

Classification tree fitted to wildlife data to try and predict tuna species based on number of variables.
tree() library used to fit and plot tree and then cross validation used to see best number of nodes to use for predicting species. 

The model struggled to predict tuna species and this is fair since most tuna species are sighted at the same time around each other making it very hard to predict.
